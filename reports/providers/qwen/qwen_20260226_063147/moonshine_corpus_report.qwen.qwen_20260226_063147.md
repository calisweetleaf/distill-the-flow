## Database Schema

The SQLite database (`moonshine_corpus.db`) contains two tables:

### conversations
Primary table with one row per conversation containing all metrics.

### messages
Individual messages with conversation linkage.

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Get high-signal debugging conversations from Period 4
SELECT * FROM conversations
WHERE topic_primary = 'debugging'
  AND period = 4
  AND information_gain > 0.58
  AND malicious_compliance < 0.25;

-- Get conversations with the most corrections
SELECT title, correction_events, topic_primary
FROM conversations
WHERE correction_events > 0
ORDER BY correction_events DESC;

-- Get all messages from a specific conversation
SELECT role, text FROM messages
WHERE conversation_id = '<conv_id>'
ORDER BY create_time;
```
